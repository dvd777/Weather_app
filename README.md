SKYCAST(Weather App)
Description:
This Weather App is a web application built using React.js that provides users with real-time weather information based on their location input. The app displays essential weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and includes additional pages for users to learn about the app, sign up or log in, and view weather forecasts for major cities worldwide.
Features:
Location-based Weather Data: Users can input their location to retrieve current weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
Additional Pages: The app includes separate pages for About Us, Sign Up/Log In, and Weather Webcast, providing users with additional information and functionality.
Real-time Weather Data: The Weather Webcast page offers real-time weather data for major cities worldwide, allowing users to stay informed about weather conditions globally.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Development Tools and Platforms :
Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code was chosen as the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for coding the website's frontend using React.js. Its rich feature set, including syntax highlighting, IntelliSense, and debugging capabilities, provided a conducive environment for efficient development.
Figma : Figma was utilized for creating wireframes and designing the website's user interface, facilitating the visual planning and layout of the project. Figma's collaborative features allowed for seamless work and iteration during the design phase.
OpenWeather API: The OpenWeather API was integrated into the project to fetch weather data. By leveraging the OpenWeather API, the Weather App was able to provide real-time weather information to users based on their location input.
GitHub : GitHub used for version control and collaboration, allowing for code management, issue tracking, and team collaboration.
JSX (JavaScript XML) : JSX (JavaScript XML) was employed within React components to render UI elements and structures, enabling a declarative and component-based approach to building the user interface. JSX allows for the seamless integration of HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code, making it easier to create and manage UI components in React applications.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were used for styling the website's components and layouts, potentially utilizing preprocessor features such as variables, mixins, and nesting for enhanced styling capabilities. CSS is essential for controlling the visual presentation of web pages, including aspects such as layout, colors, fonts, and animations.
React.js: React.js was utilized as the frontend JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. React.js is known for its component-based architecture, which allows us to break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable components. It also provides features such as state management and lifecycle methods, enabling us to create dynamic and responsive web applications with ease.
React Hook Form : React Hook Form was used for form validation within the Weather App. It provides a hook-based API for handling form submissions, field validation, and error handling, offering a streamlined approach to building forms with React.
Netlify : was utilized for the deployment of the Weather App. Netlify offers a simple and seamless platform for deploying modern web projects, providing features such as continuous deployment, automatic HTTPS.
